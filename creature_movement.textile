Back to "world database":mangosdb_struct list of tables.

h2. The `creature&#95;movement` table

This table holds all the information on each creature's waypoints. In essence, a waypoint just defines a path that the creature will follow by going from point to point. More specifically, once the creature arrives at a point, it can do different things like cast a spell, do an emote, etc. Usually this table is filled through the .wp command (and its various subcommands) in the world.

Please note that for a creature to use waypoints, its "MovementType":creature#MovementType must be 2.

h4. position&#95;x

The X position of the waypoint.

h4. position&#95;y

The Y position of the waypoint.

h4. position&#95;z

The Z position of the waypoint.

h4. waittime

The time that the creature will wait before heading to the next waypoint, in milliseconds.

h4. script&#95;id

h4. orientation

(North = 0.0; South = pi (3.14159))

Setting this field to 100 means the creature will not change its orientation upon reaching the waypoint.
