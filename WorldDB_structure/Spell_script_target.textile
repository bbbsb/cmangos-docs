h3. Description of the fields

h4. entry

The spell ID. See Spell.dbc

When adding a new entry, be sure to check to see if the spell triggers another spell. If it does, don't forget to check that spell as well to see if it has ImplictTargetA-B = 38 &#124;&#124; ImpliciteTargetA-B == 7 and if it does, add an entry in this table for it as well.

NOTE: The only valide targets for ImpliciteTargetA-B == 7 are creatures(dead or alive).

h4. type

One of these type are available

* 0 = Gameobject
* 1 = Creature
* 2 = Creature who must be dead (killed by Player or Npc)

NOTE: A creature corpse and a creature that _looks_ dead are two different things. One is actually dead and the other is just using an emote to appear dead.

h4. targetEntry

Can be: "creature&#95;template.entry":creature_template#entry or "gameobject&#95;template.entry":gameobject_template#entry depending on the choosen type.

This specified entry will be automatically targeted if it is near the player casting the spell.
