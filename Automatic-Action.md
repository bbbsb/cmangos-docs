# Automatic Action

Your bots will perform certain tasks automatically. Other tasks you can tell them to automatically perform through commands.


**Loot** - Bots will automatically loot corpses

**[AutoEquip](https://github.com/playerbot/mangos/wiki/Bot-Switches)** - Bots will automatically equip items they can use IF you set them to 'autoequip' (see [Switches](https://github.com/playerbot/mangos/wiki/Bot-Switches) or .help in game)

**[Quests](https://github.com/playerbot/mangos/wiki/InterAction-Commands)** - Bots will automatically attempt to take quests that YOU yourself take.
         Alternatively, you can tell bots to check NPC's for quests, and then add them (see [Quest](https://github.com/playerbot/mangos/wiki/InterAction-Commands) or .help in game)

**Worn Items** - Bots will automatically UnEquip items too worn to use, to keep them from breaking.

**Sell Junk** - Bots will sell Junk items they dont need everytime you interact with a vendor.

**Sell UnNeeded** - Bots will also sell other items if 'sell all' command has been given. (see [Switches](https://github.com/playerbot/mangos/wiki/Bot-Switches) or .help in game)

**Roll on Items** - Bots will automatically roll on items for need/greed/ and will also pass.

**Attack** - Bots will automatically attack non-friendly creatures or npcs if they are close enough.

**AutoVariableFollow distance** - Bots will automatically follow at varying distances/positions based on combat orders. This defaults to ON but can be turned off by giving the command /t BOTNAME or /p 'follow auto'.
