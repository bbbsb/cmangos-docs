  97.4% src/game/

bq. [TBC] stfx: not sure whats this about, should theoretically also apply to TBC but never heard of an issue there
cala : tested take ammo and found issue on current revision: ammo are not taken for all spells
(ex: 'arcane shot' does not take ammo but 'serpent sting' does). However, if no ammo in inventory no ranged spell can be casted, even those like 'arcane shot' that do not take ammo (though probably should take). I'll try to test this commit.
stfx: was this behavior ever changed? it should be tested/fixed on tbc also if needed
cala (march 13-13): this fix does allow all spells to take ammo. It should be applied to TBC firsthand, then backported to classic.

  91.2% src/game/

bq. [OK] cala : Tested on z2040, without this fix it is possible to take advantage of the unlearn mechanics to use combustion aura even after unlearning the talent. This commit fixes it.

  37.3% src/game/
  43.9% win/VC100/
  18.7% win/VC90/

bq. [REMOVE] cala : this one and the previous one are correct. In their current state, mods are needed for two purposes: TBC PvP diminishing returns (no need for classic) and modifying a paladin spell. This last one is moved into core by previous commit. If it is not broken, don't fix it.

  66.8% src/game/

bq. [REMOVE] cala : I guess thi is no longer usefull with all the recent TBC backports. Will test it.
stfx: it might very well be useful as backports have nothing to do with it.
cala : tested on z2194 and was not able to see any issue: ignoring is working as intended and without kicking anyone.

  23.7% src/shared/

bq. [OK] cala : This one looks ok but I will test it because I'm surprised it is not fixed in TBC also.
On z2194, improved sprint is indeed broken (not working and breaking sprint along). This commit fixes it.
This commit does also the job. I don't know which one is better: "new zero":https://github.com/mangoszero/server/commit/1781ac3c1e2219eaa0ce42663bc7e85b319ff482

On z2194, shapeshifting into bear form, druids do not keep the same percentage of HP. This commit fixes it.

bq. [OK] cala : This one is OK but this is only for DB. No need to backport to core. I'll put it into DB if not already there.
stfx: There are some tables which are managed by mangos and not the database providers. this one is one of them.
cala : tested on z2194 (and mangos-zero DB), this spell is already flagged as intented. This commit should be applied nonetheless to keep track of the fix.

 100.0% src/game/

bq. [OK] cala : this one is only half correct. The mana regen should occur every 2 sec See * "Mana regenaration":http://www.wowwiki.com/Talk:Mana_regeneration *, so the part fixed by this commit is correct. However, the mana regen formula was not the same for all spell casters in 1.12, it was uniformed in 2.4. I will propose a fix later to this issue and document it. In the meantime, I advice to still apply this commit, at least it will prevent casters from gaining mana twice faster than expected

 100.0% src/game/

bq. [REMOVE] cala: Core currently use TBC values for druid AP (see * "Attack Power as of April 18th 2008":http://www.wowwiki.com/Attack_power?diff=1317844&oldid=1308858 *). However, I'm unable to find if they were different in classic. I guess so as feral druids got a big "up" in TBC but without correct 1.12 values, we should trash this commit and but put a note in StatSystem.cpp stating these values need to be confirmed.
