  91.2% src/game/
   8.7% src/shared/

bq. [OK] cala : Tested on z2040, without this fix it is possible to take advantage of the unlearn mechanics to use combustion aura even after unlearning the talent. This commit fixes it.

  37.3% src/game/
  43.9% win/VC100/
  18.7% win/VC90/

bq. [REMOVE] cala : this one and the previous one are correct. In their current state, mods are needed for two purposes: TBC PvP diminishing returns (no need for classic) and modifying a paladin spell. This last one is moved into core by previous commit. If it is not broken, don't fix it.

  66.8% src/game/
  33.1% src/shared/

bq. [REMOVE] cala : I guess thi is no longer usefull with all the recent TBC backports. Will test it.
stfx: it might very well be useful as backports have nothing to do with it.
cala : tested on z2194 and was not able to see any issue: ignoring is working as intended and without kicking anyone.

  76.2% src/game/
  23.7% src/shared/

bq. [OK] cala : This one looks ok but I will test it because I'm surprised it is not fixed in TBC also.
On z2194, improved sprint is indeed broken (not working and breaking sprint along). This commit fixes it.
This commit does also the job. I don't know which one is better: "new zero":https://github.com/mangoszero/server/commit/1781ac3c1e2219eaa0ce42663bc7e85b319ff482

  51.2% sql/updates/
  18.4% sql/
  30.2% src/shared/

bq. [OK] cala : This one is OK but this is only for DB. No need to backport to core. I'll put it into DB if not already there.
stfx: There are some tables which are managed by mangos and not the database providers. this one is one of them.
cala : tested on z2194 (and mangos-zero DB), this spell is already flagged as intented. This commit should be applied nonetheless to keep track of the fix.

 100.0% src/game/

bq. [OK] cala : this one is only half correct. The mana regen should occur every 2 sec See * "Mana regenaration":http://www.wowwiki.com/Talk:Mana_regeneration *, so the part fixed by this commit is correct. However, the mana regen formula was not the same for all spell casters in 1.12, it was uniformed in 2.4. I will propose a fix later to this issue and document it. In the meantime, I advice to still apply this commit, at least it will prevent casters from gaining mana twice faster than expected
