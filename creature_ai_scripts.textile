h2. EventAI Guide

ScriptDev2 was integrated into cmangos on 04 sept 2015 and enables us to handle DB-based scripting that allows the use of a database (MySQL only right now) to specify the actions that a creature script will do.

The script is called EventAI and will be referenced like this for the rest of this guide. A basic EventAI script works with and requires only two pieces of information: <u>When it happens</u> and <u>What happens when</u>. 

The first piece of information (the <u>When it happens</u>) will be referred to as the <u>event</u>.

The second piece of information (the <u>What happens when</u>) will be referred to as the <u>action</u>. 
Currently, a single EventAI script entry can have up to three actions. 

Anyone that wants to create entries for the EventAI script needs to answer the two questions above.
Throughout the script's lifecycle, it will continually perform the actions given when a defined event happens.
Some events will only occur once while others can be timed so that they occur at a specified interval.

Now that the basic idea of the script has been explained, let's get down to the fun details. For convenience, reference tables will be provided at the end of this article that will contain short descriptions for fast lookup. Here will be included longer and more thorough descriptions. We shall first start out with what events are currently defined by the EventAI script. An event can use up to three different parameters and these parameters control different things depending on the event. If a parameter isn't specifically named for the event, it will not be used for that event.

EventAI can also support phases. A <u>phase</u> is just a way to group certain events + actions together so that the creature will perform certain actions based on what event it is currently on. The way the phase system works in EventAI is that for every event added, it needs to be specified under which phases the event <u>SHOULD NOT</u> occur. This is a bit confusing at first, so let's look at it more closely. A creature can have more than one phase, up to a max of 32 different phases (with the first one being phase 0, and last one being phase 31). How the phase selection field works is that it contains a 32bit number. Each bit in the number represents a possible phase, with the bit in the least significant position signifying phase 0 and the most significant bit signifying phase 31. The default value of zero in this field has no bits set and since the field controls when the event should NOT trigger, it would then mean that the event will always be triggered independent of the current phase the creature is in. Therefore, if you want to specify what phases the event should occur in, you need to add up all of the corresponding bits for all the other phases where the event shouldn't trigger in (confusing...yes).

For example, let's say that a certain creature using EventAI will have a max of four phases. We are then dealing with a 4 bit number in this field. Let's further say that that certain creature has an event that will only trigger in its phase 2 (a timed spell cast for instance). Then the field should contain all of the phases the event SHOULDN'T be triggered in...then out of the four bits, we leave the *third* bit alone (off) and turn on all of the other bits so we get 1011 which is equal to 11, so we put in 11 as the inverse phase mask for the event entry. As another example, let's say that the same creature previously mentioned has another event that is only triggered in the phase 0 and phase 3. This would mean that we need to ignore phase 1 and 2, so our bitmask would be 0110 which is equal to 6 so we put in 6 for this event's inverse phase mask field. Please note that both examples were tailored for a creature with four and only four phases. If you decide to add more phases later on, you will have to redefine all of the nonzero bitmasks for all of the mob's events.

Every event also has a chance field that controls the chance of that event actually occurring. Using a value of 0 in this field will make the event never occur. Values are from 0 to 100.

Now that all of the supported events have been listed and described, we shall now move on to the actions that can be performed. Each event can take up to three actions. The actions will all be performed when the event is triggered and they will be performed in the order that they have been defined. This means that, for a certain event, action 1 will be performed first, followed by action 2, then lastly by action 3. Just like event definitions, each action can use up to three different parameters but not all actions will use all three parameters. If a parameter isn't mentioned for an action, then that action does not need that parameter.

Before we start to list and explain the different actions that can be taken, we must first look at how the EventAI targeting system works. Due to technical reasons in how targetting is handled, the EventAI script cannot target anything or anyone that is not in its threat list or is not the scripted creature itself. It also can't currently target anyone specific in its threat list except by their position in the threat list. However, even then it can only target specifically the current victim, the second unit in its threat list, and the last unit in its threat list. It can also target units in its threat list at random and has two options for that: anyone in its threat list at random, or anyone in its threat list excluding the unit with the most threat. Aside from all of those external targets, the script can always target itself. More information on the "Target":creature_ai_script#Target can be found in the reference tables at the end of this guide.

One last note before we start looking at individual actions is about the texts. The EventAI script has support for localized text entries. Therefore, you can define what the mob will say in more than one language all in another table and the script will show the corresponding localized text to the corresponding client (english text to enUS/enGB clients, german text to deDE clients, etc). All of the localized text entries will have a unique text ID assigned to them and it is that text ID that will be used by any actions that require textual input.

h3. Action Explanations

<hr />

* *0 = ACTION_T_NONE*: Does nothing!

* *1 = ACTION_T_TEXT deprecated use 54 for 1 / 4+ texts and texts that require targeting*: Displays the -TextId as defined. In case -TextId2 and optionally -TextId3, the output will be randomized. Type text are defined in the "creature_ai_texts":creature_ai_texts table (say, yell, whisper, etc) along with other options for the text. All values are required to be negative.
** Parameter 1: The entry of the text that the NPC should use from "creature_ai_texts":creature_ai_texts table. Optionally a entry from other tables can be used (such as "custom_texts":custom_texts). All values are required to be negative. The type text to be displayed are defined in the texts-table itself (Say, Yell, Whisper, Emote Text, Boss Whisper, Boss Emote) Other options are also to be defined in the texts-table, such as a sound to be heard with the text and the language used in output (common, dwarvish, etc).In case this entry has a localized version of the text, the localized text will be displayed in client that support this locale.
** Parameter 2: Optional. TextId can be defined in addition. The same apply to this as explained above, however EventAI will randomize between the two.
** Parameter 3: Optional, if Parameter 2 exist. In this case, EventAI will randomize between three.

* *2 = ACTION_T_SET_FACTION*: Changes faction for a creature. When param1 is zero, creature will revert to it's default faction. Flags will determine when faction is restored to default (evade, respawn etc)
** Parameter 1: FactionId
** Parameter 2: Flags

* *3 = ACTION_T_MORPH_TO_ENTRY_OR_MODEL*: Sets either model from creature_template.entry (Param1) OR explicit modelId (Param2) for the NPC. If (Param1) AND (Param2) are both 0, NPC will demorph and revert to the default model (as specified in creature_template).
** Parameter 1: CreatureEntry
** Parameter 2: ModelId

* *4 = ACTION_T_SOUND*: When activated, the creature will play the specified sound.
** Parameter 1: The sound ID to be played. Sound IDs are contained in the DBC files.

* *5 = ACTION_T_EMOTE*: When activated, the creature will perform a visual emote. Unlike a text emote, a visual emote is one where the creature will actually move or perform a gesture.
** Parameter 1: The emote ID that the creature should perform. Emote IDs are also contained in the DBC but they can be found in the mangos source as well.

* *6 = UNUSED*: UNUSED

* *7 = UNUSED*: UNUSED

* *8 = UNUSED*: UNUSED

* *9 = ACTION_T_RANDOM_SOUND*: Similar to the ACTION_T_SOUND action, when this action is activated, it will choose at random a sound to play. This action needs all three parameters to be filled and it will pick a random entry from the three. NOTE: (1)
** Parameter 1: The sound ID to be played as choice one.
** Parameter 2: The sound ID to be played as choice two.
** Parameter 3: The sound ID to be played as choice three.

* *10 = ACTION_T_RANDOM_EMOTE*: Similar to the ACTION_T_EMOTE action, when this action is activated, it will choose at random an emote ID to emote visually. This action needs all three parameters to be filled and it will pick a random entry from the three. NOTE: (1)
** Parameter 1: The emote ID that the creature should perform as choice one.
** Parameter 2: The emote ID that the creature should perform as choice two.
** Parameter 3: The emote ID that the creature should perform as choice three.

* *11 = ACTION_T_CAST*: When activated, the creature will cast a spell specified by a spell ID on a target specified by the "Target":creature_ai_script#Target.
** Parameter 1: The spell ID to use for the cast. The value used in this field needs to be a valid spell ID.
** Parameter 2: The "Target":creature_ai_script#Target defining who the creature should cast on. The value in this field needs to be a valid "Target":creature_ai_script#Target as specified in the reference tables below.
** Parameter 3: See "spell flags":creature_ai_scripts#cast-flags. If it is 1, then the spell cast will interrupt any spells that are already in the progress of being casted; otherwise if the creature is already casting a spell and this field is 0, then this action will be skipped.

* *12 = ACTION_T_SPAWN*: When activated, the creature will summon another creature at the same spot as itself that will attack the specified target.
** Parameter 1: The creature template ID to be summoned. The value here needs to be a valid creature template ID.
** Parameter 2: The "Target":creature_ai_script#Target defining who the summoned creature will attack. The value in this field needs to be a valid "Target":creature_ai_script#Target as specified in the reference table below. NOTE: Using "Target":creature_ai_script#Target 0 will cause the summoned creature to not attack anyone.
** Parameter 3: The duration until the summoned creature should be unsummoned. The value in this field is in milliseconds or 0. If zero, then the creature will not be unsummoned until it leaves combat, but only works with t_type !=0.

* *13 = ACTION_T_THREAT_SINGLE_PCT*: When activated, this action will modify the threat of a target in the creature's threat list by the specified percent.
** Parameter 1: Threat percent that should be modified. The value in this field can range from -100 to +100. If it is negative, threat will be taken away and if positive, threat will be added.
** Parameter 2: The "Target":creature_ai_script#Target defining on whom the threat change should occur. The value in this field needs to be a valid "Target":creature_ai_script#Target as specified in the reference tables below.

* *14 = ACTION_T_THREAT_ALL_PCT*: When activated, this action will modify the threat for everyone in the creature's threat list by the specified percent.
** Parameter 1: The percent that should be used in modifying everyone's threat in the creature's threat list. The value here can range from -100 to +100. NOTE: Using -100 will cause the creature to reset everyone's threat to 0 so that everyone has the same amount of threat. It does NOT make any changes as to who is in the threat list.

* *15 = ACTION_T_QUEST_EVENT*: When activated, this action will satisfy the external completion requirement for the quest for the specified target defined by the "Target":creature_ai_script#Target. This action can only be used with player targets so it must be ensured that the "Target":creature_ai_script#Target will point to a player.
** Parameter 1: The quest template ID. The value here must be a valid quest template ID. Furthermore, the quest should have SpecialFlags &#124; 2 as it would need to be completed by an external event which is the activation of this action.

** Parameter 2: The new value to be put in the field.
** Parameter 3: The "Target":creature_ai_script#Target defining for whom the unit field should be changed. The value in this field needs to be a valid "Target":creature_ai_script#Target as specified in the reference tables below.

* *18 = ACTION_T_SET_UNIT_FLAG*: When activated, this action changes the target's "flags":https://github.com/cmangos/issues/wiki/Creature_template#unitflags by adding (turning on) more flags. For example, this action can make the creature unattackable/unselectable if the right flags are used.
** Parameter 1: The flag(s) to be set. Multiple flags can be set by using bitwise-OR on them (adding them together).
** Parameter 2: The "Target":creature_ai_script#Target defining for whom the flags should be changed. The value in this field needs to be a valid "Target":creature_ai_script#Target as specified in the reference tables below.

* *20 = ACTION_T_AUTO_ATTACK*: This action controls whether or not the creature should stop or start the auto melee attack.
** Parameter 1: If zero, then the creature will stop its melee attacks. If non-zero, then the creature will either continue its melee attacks (the action would then have no effect) or it will start its melee attacks on the target with the top threat if its melee attacks were previously stopped.

* *21 = ACTION_T_COMBAT_MOVEMENT*: This action controls whether or not the creature will always move towards its target.
** Parameter 1: If zero, then the creature will stop moving towards its victim (if its victim gets out of melee range) and will be stationary. If non-zero, then the creature will either continue to follow its victim (the action would have no effect) or it will start to follow the target with the top threat if its movement was disabled before.

* *22 = ACTION_T_SET_PHASE*: When activated, this action sets the creature's event to the specified value.
** Parameter 1: The new phase to set the creature in. This number must be an integer between 0 and 31 inclusive.

* *26 = ACTION_T_QUEST_EVENT_ALL*: This action does the same thing as the ACTION_T_QUEST_EVENT does but it does it for all players in the creature's threat list. Note that if a player is not in its threat list for whatever reason, he/she won't get the quest completed.
** Parameter 1: The quest ID to finish for everyone.

* *27 = ACTION_T_CASTCREATUREGO_ALL*: This action does the same thing as the ACTION_T_CASTCREATUREGO does but it does it for all players in the creature's threat list. Note that if a player is not in its threat list for whatever reason, he/she won't receive the cast emulation.

** Parameter 2: The spell ID whose auras will be removed.

* *29 = ACTION_T_RANGED_MOVEMENT*: This action changes the movement type generator to ranged type using the specified values for angle and distance. Note that specifying zero angle and distance will make it just melee instead.
** Parameter 1: The distance the mob should keep between it and its target.
** Parameter 2: The angle the mob should use.

* *30 = ACTION_T_RANDOM_PHASE*: Randomly sets the phase to one from the three parameter choices. NOTE: (1)

** Parameter 1: The creature template ID to be summoned. The value here needs to be a valid creature template ID.
** Parameter 2: The "Target":creature_ai_script#Target defining who the summoned creature will attack. The value in this field needs to be a valid "Target":creature_ai_script#Target as specified in the reference tables below. NOTE: Using "Target":creature_ai_script#Target 0 will cause the summoned creature to not attack anyone.
